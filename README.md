# IPASS
Sample-level pseudotime analysis using multi-modality single cell data
IPASS (Integrative Pseudotime Analysis at Sample level of Single-cell data) extends SampleClock to multi-sample single-cell omics data of different modalities. For multi-modality multi-sample single-cell omics data of samples with known severity levels, IPASS could (a)measure sample-sample distance,  (b)assign sample-level pseudotime, and (c) compare the features provided by different modalities. In this way, IPASS allows combinatory analysis of datasets cross studies, platforms, or modality.
